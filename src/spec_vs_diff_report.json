  "summary": "Locked-in Goals cards were updated to place a smaller \"Check in\" button on the same row as the stats, with the ticker remaining above. However, the requested refactor to avoid duplicating stats logic was not fully achieved: stats computation and data fetching are duplicated between the ticker and the new stats component.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Refactor the CheckInTicker component rendering so that the stats block can be positioned in the same row as the \"Check in\" button within the Locked-in Goals card without duplicating stats logic.",
      "reason": "The diff introduces a separate `CheckInStats` component, but it repeats the same data fetching (`useGetDailyCheckInsByGoal`, `useGetGoal`) and recomputes stats (`computeCheckInStats`) independently from `CheckInTicker`, which still performs its own fetch+compute for rendering the ticker bars. This duplicates stats logic rather than refactoring it into a shared structure.",
