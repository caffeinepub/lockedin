However, REQ-1 backend work is not evidenced at all, and the diff is truncated before showing the rest of the save sequence (milestones/tasks/lock-in), success handling (toast + onSaveComplete), and guaranteed isSaving reset/disabled button behavior.",

      "reason": "No backend file changes are shown; `backend/main.mo` is not modified in the diff summary, so there is no evidence the method was added or that durationDays is persisted.",

      "requirement": "Auto Planner “Save & Lock In” performs the full save sequence (create goal, add milestones/weekly tasks/daily tasks, lock in goal) and on success shows a success toast and calls `onSaveComplete()`; on any failure shows error toast and resets `isSaving`; button remains disabled during save.",
      "reason": "AutoPlannerReview.tsx is truncated before showing milestones/tasks/lock-in steps and the final success/failure UI state handling. The visible portion sets `setIsSaving(true)` but does not show any `finally`/reset, success toast, `onSaveComplete()` call, or button disabled binding.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/AutoPlanner/AutoPlannerReview.tsx (truncated): shows actor check, missing-method guard, `setIsSaving(true)`, goal creation + verification; truncates at \"// Step 3: Add milestones...\" before rest of sequence and any completion/reset logic"
